"""Selecting one execution path out of the candidate graph.

The Layer-2 graph is a *candidate* structure: a goal subgraph may hold several
achievers, and ``SkillCompositionGraph.execution_order()`` is therefore only a
partial order over candidates -- never a plan.  Something has to choose.  That
chooser is a deterministic policy here and a trained decision model later; both
answer the same question, one node at a time:

    graph + completed + failed  ->  the next SkillNode

Keeping the interface incremental (rather than "emit the whole sequence") is
what lets a future model re-decide after every execution, and what lets a
failed primary candidate hand off to its ``FALLBACK_TO`` successor.
